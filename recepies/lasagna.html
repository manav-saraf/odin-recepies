    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Lasagna is the name of one of the oldest and best-known pasta shapes. It
      is usually rectangular or ribbon shaped, thicker than tagliatelle, made
      from a dough based on flour and eggs, with numerous local variants.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tradition of lasagna originated in Emilia Romagna, and from there it
      has become one of the symbols of Italian cuisine throughout the world.
      Abroad, lasagne alla bolognese, made with béchamel and meat sauce, is well
      known.
